Store for my answers to programming solutions to advanced statistics example sheets

For sheet 1, histogram plotting codes for GNUplot were obtained from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5787096/normalizing-histogram-bins-in-gnuplot

## Sheet 1
Shows that -1/lambda * ln r, where r = rand[0,1], produces and exponential distribution with parameter lambda.
Shows that the average of N random numbers generated in several batches produces a Gaussian distribution

## Sheet 2 
Monte Carlo estimations of pi done in 2D and 3D space

## Sheet 3
Gillespie algorithm implementation for a random walk with equal transition rates
Added a "test" where initial condition is halfway -> would expect conditional absorbtion events ~ 0.5 unconditional absorbtion events (when transition rates are equal). This is the case!

## Sheet 4
Euler integrate the Brusselator
Gillespie simulation of Brusselator - doesn't work!
Euler integration of coexistence game
